## Principle of operation
The system consists of the following electrical blocks:
Microcontroller board with TFT display
H-brigdes block
Battery with protection against excessive discharge
Reverse polarity protection
Step-down converter

To protect battery from over-discharge simple elecronic circuit was used.

All important components have been especjally selected to achieve minimal current leakage during low voltage state in battery. The principle of operation is simple. If the input voltage (on battery connectors) exceeds fixed value, then the load is switched on, while if it falls below this value, the load is disconnected. When the voltage is within the designated "bands", the state of the output is maintained.


This device contains one P-channel high-side MOSFET and one N-channel low-side MOSFET with an integrateddriver IC in one package. The Industrial & Multipurpose NovalithICâ„¢ IFX007T is the interface between themicrocontroller and the motor, equipped with diagnostic and protection functions
